            <p>
              All right - I do so many courses each year, so I won't list them
              all. Just the ones I believe have been most memorable.
            </p>
            <h4>Advanced Animal Training</h4>
            <p>
              Comprehensive course on advanced animal training - including
              motivation, classical conditioning, learning condition and lots of
              other stuff. Really relevant for all animal trainers, but it also
              gives another understanding of human behaviour - after all, we are
              just animals.
            </p>
            <h4>Various marketing courses</h4>
            <p>
              I have taken several marketing courses aimed at online marketing
              from Lise Halsskov, Christina Klitsgaard, Trine Ravnkilde and
              Gitte Stouenberg.
            </p>
            <h4>Equine Calming Signals</h4>
            <p>
              Subtle body language in horses and how they use it to communicate
              with each other and their environment. Lots of food for thought in
              regards to human interactions as well as lots of learning on
              physiological stress and hormones across species.
            </p>
            <h4>Acupuncture & dry needling (K1 & K2)</h4>
            <p>
              K1 and K2 practical acupuncture and dry needling courses for
              physiotherapist held by the Danish Society for Acupuncture in
              Physiotherapy.

              <h4>Board member</h4>
              <p>
                  I have been a board member of the association of Danish Equine
                  Physiotherapists as well as a local evening school.
                </p>
                <h4>Volunteer at smukfest</h4>
                <p>
                    Since I was a teen I have been volunteering at Smukfest - and from
                    2010-2023 I have been part of the management of their lifeguard
                    team making sure my people kept the guests safe from drowning.
                </p>
                <h4>Languages</h4>
                <p>
                    I am fluent in Danish (my mother tongue) and English. I have been
                    in Scotland as en exchange student and finished 6th grade of High
                    School there and besides that I have done a 2 year PgDip programme
                    at Liverpool University reading lots of academic papers in
                    English. Oh, and I love to travel - so I also know bits and pieces
                    of German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, French, nordic languages and
                    the universal language of charades.
                </p>
                <h4>The Home Front</h4>
                <p>On the home front I am a jack of all trades; we live on a farm with horses, sheep and cats. We homeschool our daughter following the unschooling principles. And we are doing a major (and very) nice renovation, doing most of the work ourselves...</p>
